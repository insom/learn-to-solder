Learn to Solder Badge
=====================

The build for this is [documented on my website][d].

This repository contains the KiCad/PCBnew `kicad_pcb` new file, along with all
of the gerbers that you would need to send to the board house.

The `Boards.zip` file contains gerbers named in the way that Dirty PCBs
require (which is where I got my first batch made).
